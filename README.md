Introducing CanvasLinks: Unlocking the Power of Visual Connections in Obsidian

Hey fellow Obsidian enthusiasts!

As a power user of Obsidian, I've always been fascinated by the potential of visual connections in note-taking. The official Canvas plugin is an amazing tool for creating mind maps and visualizing relationships between notes. However, I found myself wanting more - specifically, the ability to click on an image and link it to a different document in my vault.

That's why I'm excited to introduce CanvasLinks, a plugin that takes the Canvas plugin to the next level!

What does CanvasLinks do?

CanvasLinks allows you to click on an image in your Obsidian vault and link it to a different document. This means you can create a visual representation of your notes, with images serving as gateways to related documents.

Imagine being able to:

Click on a screenshot of a code snippet and jump to the corresponding code file
Tap on a diagram of a system architecture and navigate to the relevant documentation
Explore a mind map of your research project, with images linking to individual studies or papers
How does it work?

Install CanvasLinks from the Obsidian plugin repository
Create an image in your Obsidian vault (e.g., a screenshot, diagram, or photo)
Right-click on the image and select "Link to document"
Choose the document you want to link to from your vault
Click on the image to navigate to the linked document
Why is this useful?

CanvasLinks unlocks new possibilities for visual knowledge management in Obsidian. By linking images to documents, you can:

Create a more intuitive and interactive note-taking experience
Enhance your understanding of complex relationships between notes
Save time by quickly navigating to related documents
